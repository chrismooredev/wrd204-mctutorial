
prototype: setup a mc server
	go over:
		* who this guide is for/expected knowledge or materials
		* why you want to do it yourself, why you should have it hosted
		* should have a server already
		* install java (windows/linux)
		* get server running
			eula
			common server.properties changes
				seed/ports/etc
			mods? pros/cons
				resource utilization
				hosting bandwidth
				updating modpack vs vanilla
			world maintenance
				backing up
				delete
		* subsection for port forwarding, if necessary
		* create domain(s?) w/ Google Domains
		* ports: apartment/mailbox number | addresses: apartment address
	troubleshooting:
		domain doesn't work: wait longer, double check the addresses/ports
		game doesn't break blocks immediatly: network or resource bottleneck
		game's screen jumps around/FPS isn't stable: clientside problem, server is probably fine
		only OPs can change blocks near spawn: server.properties
		can't connect to IP:
			if hosting on own machine: does localhost work?
				NAT: you may have to use a different address than the one others use
			if hosting on other machine: can you ping it?
		failed to bind to port: other servers using the same port?
			check for general connectivity
