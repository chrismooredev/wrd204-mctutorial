				If you are using a Ubuntu/Debian-based Server (If you are using linux, but aren't sure, you probably are), you can use this simple command to install a version of Java suitable for the server.
				``` bash
				sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre-headless
				```
		h3 Putting Java on the Path
		.windows
			:markdown-it(html)
				* Get Java's installation folder
					1. Navigate to `C:\Program Files\Java`.
					2. Select a folder
						* Prefer folders starting with `jdk` over `jre`
						* Prefer folders with a higher version number
					3. Enter that folder, and hold shift while right-clicking the `bin` folder.
					4. Select `Copy as path`
				* Add the folder to the system or user path
					1. Press the windows key (<span class="key icon fab fa-windows"></span>) and type `path`
					2. Select either `Edit the system environment variables` or `Edit environment variables for your account`
						* If you chose the system-wide option, you may have to click `Environment Variables...` in the window that pops up
					3. Double click on the `Path` entry to edit it
					4. Click `New` and paste the previously-copied Java bin folder location into the new row
					5. Hit `Ok` until the opened windows are closed
		.apple Double-check that the installation was successful by running #[code java] in your terminal. If you get a #[code command not found] error, you may have to repeat the code block above.
		.ubuntu For Linux systems, installation should have already put Java on your path.
