			1. Create a new folder on your computer to put the server files
				- The server will put all of its own files here, so do not use a preexisting folder!
			2. Download the latest Minecraft server .jar file from [minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/) to that new folder, and rename it to `minecraft_server.jar`
			3. Open a terminal inside that new folder, to run your Minecraft server in.
		+ossection(os.windows).
			To open a terminal inside a folder, shift-right click on an empty part in the folder, and choose 'Open Powershell Window Here' or 'Open Command Window Here'

			*[-Xms]: Minimum amount of RAM given to the server
			*[-Xmx]: Maximum amount of RAM given to the server
			*[EULA]: End User License Agreement. Lines out rules for server owners. Most talked about clause within the Minecraft community is that server owners are not allowed to trade/sell in-game benefits for out-of-game items or currency.
			4. In your terminal, <abbr title="Enter the following in your terminal, and hit Enter">run</abbr> the command
				`java -Xms1024M -Xmx1024M  -jar minecraft_server.jar -nogui`  
				*Change `1024` to be 1024 times the suggested RAM amount. Both -Xms and -Xmx should have the same value.*
			5. The server will immediately exit, because you need to agree to the server EULA.
			6. Open the generated `eula.txt` file, read the EULA, and replace `eula=false` with `eula=true`
			7. Run the same command you used earlier again (you can hit Up to bring it back)
			### You now have a fully functioning Minecraft server!
			If you would like to test your server at this stage, you can go open Minecraft on the same computer, and use `localhost` as the server address.
		+ossection(os.windows).
			A window may pop up to allow your Minecraft server through the firewall. You should allow it through.
		+ossection([os.macos, os.linux]).
