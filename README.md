I created this tutorial for my WRD204 Technical Writing class.  
[View me on GitHub Pages!](https://csm123199.github.io/wrd204-mctutorial)

This is a static site built with Parcel, and coded in Pug, TypeScript, and SCSS. Material Design look provided mostly by [Material Components for the Web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web)



## Development
* Clone the repo
* `cd` into the repo folder
* `npm install` to install dependencies
* `npm start` to start the development server.
  * You can edit nearly any file in the `src/` and should see your results in your browser at `localhost:1234` as you save.
* `npm run build` to build it for publishing (or commiting to docs/ for GitHub Pages)
